---

Create a professional, teacher-friendly how-to guide for **RoutineReady**, a visual daily schedule display app designed for primary/elementary school classrooms. This guide will be attached to the welcome email sent to each new teacher account.

## Formatting & Style Requirements

- Output as a clean, PDF-ready document using headings, numbered steps, bullet points, and bold text. No raw HTML or code.
- Use section header emoji/icons for visual scannability (e.g. a wave emoji for welcome, a palette emoji for themes).
- Professional but warm and encouraging tone — written for teachers who may not be tech-savvy.
- Use numbered step-by-step instructions wherever a teacher needs to perform actions.
- Aim for approximately 8–12 pages when rendered as a PDF.
- Use "you" to address the teacher directly.
- Where helpful, include short "Tip" callout boxes (bold "Tip:" prefix).

## Sections to Include

Write the guide with the following sections, in this order. Use the details provided for accuracy — these reflect the actual app.

### 1. Welcome & Getting Started

- Warm welcome to RoutineReady.
- Explain that the teacher's account has been created for them and they will have received login credentials (email and password) from their school administrator or from RoutineReady support.
- The app is accessed via a web browser — no installation required. Provide a placeholder URL: `[your-school-url]` (the admin will have provided the specific link).
- On the login page, enter your email and password and click "Sign In."
- After first login, the Setup Wizard will guide you through initial configuration.

### 2. Setup Wizard (3 Steps)

Walk through each step:

**Step 1 — Welcome Screen**
- A friendly welcome message appears. Click "Get Started" to begin, or "Skip Setup" if you want to configure things later.

**Step 2 — School & Classroom Information**
- **School Name** (required) — e.g. "Riverside Elementary School"
- **Class / Room Name** (required) — e.g. "Room 5A" or "Reception Class"
- **Lead Teacher Name** (required) — e.g. "Mrs. Johnson"
- **Device Name** (optional) — useful if you have multiple screens, e.g. "Main Display" or "Back Wall Screen"

**Step 3 — Quick Tips for Success**
The wizard shows four tips before you finish:
1. **High Visibility** — Position the display where all students can see it clearly.
2. **Use Pictures** — Upload images for visual learners and younger students.
3. **Consistent Timing** — Keep transitions predictable so students know what to expect.
4. **Save Templates** — Create templates for different day types (e.g. "Monday Schedule," "PE Day").

### 3. Building Your First Routine

Cover these actions with numbered steps:

- **Adding a task**: Click the "Add Task" button. A new task appears with default values (named "New Task," 30 minutes duration).
- **Editing a task**: Click on any task to open the edit panel. You can change:
  - **Task Name** — type whatever you like (e.g. "Morning Reading," "Lunch Break").
  - **Duration** — enter the number of minutes, or use the **+5** and **−5** buttons for quick adjustment. Duration can range from 5 to 180 minutes.
  - **Icon** — choose from 24 classroom-themed icons: Book, Pencil, Calculator, Art (palette), Music, Science (flask), Snack (apple), Lunch (utensils), PE/Sports, Outdoor (trees), Computer, Group Work, Morning (sun), Afternoon (moon), Home Time, Bus, Backpack, Circle Time, Thinking (brain), Hand Raise, Star/Award, Wellness (heart), Geography (globe), Language.
  - **Image** — optionally upload your own image (max 2 MB). Great for visual learners — use photos of actual classroom areas, PECS-style symbols, or student-created artwork.
- **Setting the start time**: Use the time picker to set when your day begins (default is 8:00 AM). The end time is calculated automatically from your task durations.
- **Task size** (advanced): You can adjust each task's card width (120–400 px) and height (100–300 px) to emphasise important tasks or fit more on screen. Not available in Auto-Pan mode.
- **Deleting a task**: Click the trash icon on any task in the edit panel.
- **Tip:** Start simple — add your main blocks (Morning Work, Break, Literacy, Lunch, etc.) and refine from there.

### 4. Templates

- **Saving a template**: Once you have built a routine you are happy with, click "Save as Template" and give it a name (e.g. "Standard Monday," "Assembly Day," "Wet Play Schedule"). The template saves your start time, all tasks, and their settings.
- **Loading a template**: Click "Load Now" on any saved template to instantly apply it to the current timeline.
- **Deleting a template**: Click the delete button on a template. A confirmation dialog will appear. Note: deleting a template also removes it from any weekly schedule assignments.

### 5. Weekly Schedule

- The Weekly Schedule lets you assign templates to specific days of the week (Monday–Friday).
- **Assigning a template**: Select a template and click "Assign to Day," then choose the day.
- **Auto-loading**: At midnight, the app automatically loads the template assigned to the current day — so your display is ready each morning without any action from you.
- **Today indicator**: The current day is highlighted so you can see at a glance which schedule is active.
- **Each day shows**: The template name, start and end times, and number of tasks.
- **Removing an assignment**: Click "Remove" on any day to unassign its template.
- **Tip:** Set up your full week once, and you won't need to touch it again unless your timetable changes.

### 6. Understanding Your Display & Choosing the Right Mode

**This is the most important section of the guide.** Take time to get this right — it makes the difference between a display that looks professional and one that doesn't quite fit.

RoutineReady offers **three display modes**. The right choice depends on what kind of screen you are displaying on.

#### What kind of screen do you have?

Help the teacher identify their screen:
- **Ultra-wide monitor (21:9 ratio)** — a very wide, relatively short screen. Common in some newer classrooms. → Use **Horizontal Mode**.
- **Standard TV or monitor (16:9 ratio)** — the most common type. Wall-mounted TVs, desktop monitors, interactive whiteboards that are roughly rectangular. → Use **Multi-Row Mode**.
- **Any screen where you want a simplified, focused view** — or if you are unsure. → Use **Auto-Pan Mode**.

#### Decision Guide

Present this as a clear decision flowchart or "if/then" list:

- **If** your screen is an ultra-wide (21:9) monitor → choose **Horizontal Mode**. Your tasks will display in a single scrolling row from left to right, making full use of the width.
- **If** your screen is a standard TV, monitor, or interactive whiteboard (16:9) → choose **Multi-Row Mode**. Your tasks will wrap across multiple rows to fill the screen.
  - Set the **Number of Rows** using the slider — start with 2 or 3 rows and adjust until your tasks fit without being too small or too cramped.
  - Choose a **Path Direction**:
    - **Sequential** — every row reads left to right (→ → →). Simpler for younger students.
    - **Snake** — rows alternate direction (→ then ← then →), like reading a board game. Uses space more efficiently and creates a natural visual flow.
- **If** you want a calm, focused display that only shows the current task and the next task → choose **Auto-Pan Mode**. This is great for students who are overwhelmed by seeing the whole day at once.
  - You can add a **top banner image** (e.g. your school logo) and a **bottom banner image**.
  - Enable the optional **live clock** so students can see the current time.
  - Adjust the **Task Tile Height** (30%–80% of the display) to make the current task card larger or smaller.

**Tip:** Not sure? Start with **Multi-Row Mode** with 2 rows and **Snake** path direction — it works well on most classroom screens.

### 7. Display Settings

**Getting your display settings right is essential.** Do this before adjusting themes or anything else.

#### Step 1 — Set the Resolution

The resolution should match the physical resolution of the screen you are displaying on.

- **Presets available:**
  - **2560 × 1080** — for ultra-wide 21:9 screens
  - **1920 × 1080** — for standard Full HD 16:9 screens (the most common)
- **Custom resolution**: If your screen has a different resolution, enter the exact width (800–7680 px) and height (600–2160 px) manually. Check your screen's documentation or settings menu if you are unsure.

**Tip:** If you don't know your screen's resolution, start with 1920 × 1080 — it is the most common and will work acceptably on most displays.

#### Step 2 — Adjust the Scale

Use the **Scale slider** (50%–150%, in 5% steps) to fine-tune how content fits on your screen.

- If tasks look **too small** or there is too much empty space → increase the scale.
- If tasks are **cut off** or overlapping the edges → decrease the scale.
- Default is 100%. Most teachers find a value between 85% and 110% works best.

#### Step 3 — Choose a Transition Style

The transition indicator appears between tasks to show progress:

1. **Progress Line** — a simple, clean line with a moving dot (like a music player progress bar). Professional and minimal.
2. **Road with Mascot** — a playful illustrated road with a character that travels along it as time passes. You can upload a **custom mascot image** (e.g. your class mascot or a favourite character). The default mascot is a car.

#### Display Capacity Warnings

If you add more tasks than your display can comfortably fit, RoutineReady will show a warning. If you see this:
- Reduce the number of tasks, or make task cards smaller (reduce width/height).
- Increase the number of rows (in Multi-Row mode).
- Switch to Auto-Pan mode, which is not width-limited.
- Adjust the scale slider down.

### 8. Themes

#### Preset Themes (6 built-in)

You can instantly apply any of these:

1. **Ocean Calm** — soothing blue and teal tones. Great for a calming classroom feel.
2. **Forest Friends** — greens and nature tones with warm yellow card backgrounds.
3. **Sunshine Day** — bright yellows and oranges. Cheerful and energising.
4. **Pastel Dreams** — soft purples and pinks. Gentle and inviting.
5. **High Contrast** — white and grey with bold black borders and yellow highlighting. Designed for maximum readability and accessibility.
6. **Superhero Power** — bold reds, purples, and blues with comic-style shadows and uppercase text. Fun and high-energy.

#### Custom Theme Editor

Want to match your classroom decor or school colours? The custom theme editor lets you control:

- **Theme Name & Emoji** — give your theme a name and pick an emoji to identify it.
- **Background Gradient** — choose start and end colours for the screen background.
- **Task Card Design:**
  - Card background colour
  - Border colour and width (1–6 px)
  - Corner style — from extra rounded (bubbly) to sharp corners (structured), with 6 options
- **Font Style** — 18 options including:
  - Standard weights (Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Extra Bold, Comic)
  - **Twinkl Cursive Looped** (5 weights) — ideal for UK schools teaching joined handwriting
  - **Twinkl Cursive Unlooped** (5 weights)
  - **Twinkl Precursive** (5 weights) — ideal for younger children learning letter formation
- **Current Task Highlight** — customise the glow colour, background overlay, and whether the border is enhanced on the active task.
- **Time Progress Colours** — set different colours for past/done, current/active, and future/next time indicators.

A **live preview** updates in real time as you make changes, so you can see exactly how your display will look before saving.

**Tip:** The Twinkl handwriting fonts are wonderful for Early Years and KS1 classrooms — students see the same letter formation style on the display as in their handwriting practice.

### 9. The Display View (What Students See)

When you switch to the display view, this is what appears on your classroom screen:

- **Task cards** showing the task name, duration, and icon or image, styled with your chosen theme.
- **Time cards** at the start and end showing the schedule's start and end times.
- **Transition indicators** between tasks showing progress as time passes.
- **Current task highlighting** — the active task glows and is visually emphasised so students always know "what are we doing now?"
- **Today's schedule badge** — if a template is loaded via the weekly schedule, its name appears in the top-left corner (e.g. "Monday Schedule").
- **Admin button** — a small gear icon labelled "Admin" sits in the top-right corner. Click it to return to the editing/settings view. Students will generally ignore it, but you can access settings at any time.

In **Auto-Pan mode**, the display is simplified: the current task is shown large and prominent, with the next task shown smaller below it, plus any banners and the optional clock.

### 10. Setup Info & Account Management

- You can edit your school and classroom information at any time from the settings area (School Name, Class/Room Name, Lead Teacher Name, Device Name).
- **Reset to Default** — if you want to start completely fresh, use the reset option to return all settings to their defaults. This will clear your current timeline but will not delete saved templates.

### 11. Tips & Best Practices

End with practical advice:

1. **Position your display at eye level** where all students can see it — ideally a wall-mounted TV or monitor at the front of the classroom.
2. **Use images for visual learners** — especially for younger students or those with additional needs. Upload photos of classroom areas, symbols, or visual cues.
3. **Keep timing consistent** — students thrive on predictability. Try to keep transition times the same each day.
4. **Save templates for each day type** — create a "Standard Monday," "PE Day," "Assembly Day," etc. Once saved, assign them to your weekly schedule and the display takes care of itself.
5. **Get your display settings right first** — set the correct resolution and scale before spending time on themes. A well-fitted display looks professional even with the default theme.
6. **Watch for display capacity warnings** — if you see a warning, your tasks may not all fit on screen. Reduce task sizes, add more rows, or switch to Auto-Pan mode.
7. **Start simple, then customise** — get your basic routine working first. You can always refine icons, images, themes, and layout later.
8. **Use High Contrast theme for accessibility** — if you have students with visual impairments, the High Contrast theme with bold borders and clear colours is the best choice.
